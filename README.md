**Project Description:** **Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning**

Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and reducing treatment costs. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on clinical and histological features.

The dataset typically used (e.g., the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset) contains features such as cell radius, texture, perimeter, smoothness, compactness, and other characteristics extracted from medical imaging or biopsy results.

The project involves:

**Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, normalizing features, and preparing data for training.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing data distributions and relationships to understand feature importance.

**Model Building** – Training machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression to fit training and testing dataset and predicting outcomes based on it.

**Model Evaluation** – Using metrics like accuracy, recall to measure performance.

**Model Optimization –** Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to improve predictive accuracy.


**Expected Outcomes**-

A trained machine learning model capable of classifying breast cancer tumors with high accuracy.

Insights into the most influential features contributing to diagnosis.

A potential decision-support tool to assist doctors in early breast cancer detection.
